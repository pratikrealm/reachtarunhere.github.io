~~As this year's new year resolution~~ Wait! Let's not call it a new year resolution as it tends to increase the chances of failure. As an attempt to get a little fit I have decided to try out the 7-minute workout. Besides my laziness, another reason why I have been avoiding exercise in the morning is that I feel it may drain too much energy and I won't have much left for the rest of day. Recently I came across [this](https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-exercising-makes-us-happier)  post which mentions exactly the opposite of what I think. The reason behind their theory is **endorphins**. Endorphins are natural painkillers and released when we exercise but the good point is that they remain in the body throughout the day and make us feel happy. So I bought into all of the above and today is my first day of the experiment.

Warning: Mute the music first its unbearable.

So how do I feel now? - **Tired**, **Really Tired**!
Happy? - I don't know.

Nevertheless, I will try to carry this on for the rest of the week and write how I feel about it in the long run.
