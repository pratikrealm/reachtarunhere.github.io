Well almost!. I need to survive another Compree on 16th. Looking back this one has been a real mixed bag and I am glad that it is getting over. The temperatures here are unbearable and I really want to go home and rest now before serious GSoC work gets started. Unfortunately, this will not be possible thanks to the Code. Fun. Do. design deadline on 20th.

In the last few months, I have learned a few things the hard way and I guess I won't slip again on these.

- Don't criticize people even if they ask you too. Most of the times this is just an act and they are really not interested and end up getting pissed off when the truth is bluntly stated.

- Value company of people who matter. Most of my single degree friends are leaving for PS now. I feel sad about not spending enough time with them.

- **Do Stuff!** - I can't state how important this is and how I have been screwing myself up by not doing stuff. I have been constantly worried about what will I do after school. What books should I read? What courses to take?  What if I don't get a good GPA (this one has been resolved :/ )? This had completely paralysed me and I am still recovering from this bad stage. I remember how anything related to programming used to be exciting and now I weigh things too much by their merit. I have in fact realized that I was so stuck making choices that I ended up taking none of the options. I could have probably read a couple of books in the time I spent I deciding what would be the best resource to follow. This paralysis is not completely new to me. Back in the JEE days, I used to select the toughest problems/books and then after not being able to solve them would go back to easier stuff. This vicious cycle of easy-hard-this-book-that-book has been really bad for me. Doing Stuff solves this exact problem - there isn't much time to make a choice. You just do. I have decided to do.

On a positive note, I am really excited about the summer. I guess there will be a lot of actual doing. :)
