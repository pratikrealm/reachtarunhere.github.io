title: Blogs/Books/Movies-I Like

This is just an index of my recommendations for Books, Movies & Articles/Blog Posts on the Internet. Obviously, the list is incomplete because I am not putting in much effort into moving older stuff here.

# Online Stuff

Below is a list of blogs I like in no particular order:

- [Daniel Lemire's Blog](http://lemire.me/) - Interesting musing on Tech and how it affects us. Posts on comparing life in academia to industry and reason why (not) to do a PhD.

- [Everything I Know About Python...](https://jeffknupp.com) - Intuitive explanations of Python Constructs.

- [Math âˆ© Programming](https://jeremykun.com/) - Math for programmers.

- [effbot.org](effbot.org) -  Hundreds of articles on Python and related technologies.

- [Materials by Dr Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com) - Among everything list here. THIS is the best one if you are a programmer/hacker. The elegance of the code will make you wonder "Can I do it better?" and the answer almost always will be "No".** Shameless Plug: ** *Also give a look to notebooks in [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python)  some of which were done by me under his guidance.*

- [Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) - Essays mostly on Tech, Startups and LISP by a great hacker. These are often long so make sure you have time on your hands because it would be impossible to stop reading until you are done.

- [James Altucher's Site](http://www.jamesaltucher.com) - Controversial Life Advice. Only 15-20% of posts are worth reading. But the quality of this small percentage is outstanding.

- [Cambridge Coding Blog](https://blog.cambridgecoding.com) - Introductory ML Posts using Python.
 
- [Andrej Karpathy's Blog](http://karpathy.github.io) - Very high-quality material on AI, Neural Networks from a real expert in the area.

# Books

I don't read a lot but I am trying to change that. My reading lists along with some reviews are available on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32095774-tarun-vangani).

###  Currently Reading:
- **AIMA 3rd Ed** as a preparatory exercise for GSoC 16.
- **iWoz** - Steve Wozniak's Autobiography. I will resume after the comprees are done. So far the book has maintained a really exciting tone.

### All Time Favourites
- **Surely You are Joking** - Made me realize profs can be cool people too. I have read a couple of more books on Feynman and watched a couple of documentaries. 
- **The Last Lecture** - Prof Randy Pausch managed to change my opinion about several things in life with this little book. I still don't have a clean desk but I now realize the merits of one.


# Movies

Like most BITSians I tend to watch a lot of movies. I use [tastekid](tastekid.com) for movie recommendations. It has the functionality to import movies from Facebook which came in pretty handy in my case.

Here goes the list of nice ones I have watched this semester:

- **Million Dollar Baby** - Really inspiring in the beginning but the ending is really sad. Best movie I watched this semester (3-2).
- **Warrior** - Another fighting movie (MMA). I really liked the soundtrack.  The movie has a lot of family drama (which I tend to dislike) and for me, the fights were the best part.

I also watched some other among them I would say King's Speech was very average and in my opinion is hyped.

### All Time Favourites:
- **October Sky** - I cry everytime I watch the last scene. Also makes me realize the opportunity I am wasting by not working hard enough at college.
- **Schindler's List** - Got me interested in reading about World War. Great Movie! WARNING: The movie is really sad and graphic.
- **The Pianist** - Same as above.
- **Dead Poet's Society** - Like 3 Idiots but only 100 x better.
- ** Mary Kom ** - Very inspirational boxing movie. The book is even better. [Book Review](http://reachtarunhere.github.io/2016/08/20/Review-Unbreakable-Mary-Kom/)
