<img style="float: left;margin: 10px;" src="{{ site.url }}/public/img/instaprofile.jpg"> My name is Tarun. I am a recovering nerd now getting lost in Singapore in an attempt to find myself. Professionally, I am a Research Engineer at the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) (A*STAR)'s - Human Language Technology Unit where I work on Machine Translation & Conversational Systems.

In the past, I worked with [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) contributing to [implementations](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) as well as documentation for the textbook Artifical Intelligence: A Modern Approach. I [wheeled my way](https://www.businessinsider.sg/inside-most-exclusive-college-2017-6/?r=US&IR=T) into BITS Pilani to study Electronics-Instrumentation & Biological Sciences. Sans the academics, I had a [key role](https://epcbits.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/department-of-visual-media/) in organizing India's second largest cultural festival (a non-stop [96 hours party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh7WkyNXNRE)).

## Blog

The blog is named Stanley as a tribute to [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%28vehicle%29)  the autonomous car which got me interested in CV and ML.
